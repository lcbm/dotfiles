## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- `git`: to clone the repo
- `zsh` or `bash`: to actually run the dotfiles
- `sudo`: some configs may need that

### Getting Started

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/lcbm/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
$ zsh # or just close and open your terminal again.
```

> **note**: this script is still a work in progress, for this reason it still does not copy over the files to the $HOME directory -- you should do this manually.
